## My process
- First I build the structure with html
- After this I analysed the Figma file for the dimensions and fonts
- After that started with css and then compled the overall design
- Then I updated the fonts and after that added the shadow and hover effect

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned to use locally downloaded font using the css and why variable font is better that using individual styles of different fonts.

```css
@font-face{
    font-family: "Figtree";
    src: url(./assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf) format("truetype");
    font-weight: 100 900;
    font-style: normal;
}
@font-face {
    font-family: "Figtree";
    src: url(./assets/fonts/Figtree-Italic-VariableFont_wght.ttf) format("truetype");
    font-weight: 100 900;
    font-style: italic;
```

### Useful resources

- [Font Face Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@font-face) - This helped me with using the locally downloaded fonts.
